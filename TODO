* TODO Fix WAVE/MP3 formats to support MP3 audio in a WAVE container
  Instead of WaveAudio generating a nasty "compression not supported" error,
  its is_type() classmethod should return False.
  And, MP3Audio's is_type() classmethod should check for MP3 compressed
  RIFF WAVE containers.
  This isn't likely to mess up decoding, but may confuse ID3 tagging.
* TODO Allow file template to be specified on the command line
  When making new files with track2track, cd2track, etc.
* TODO [#A] Update the website with the latest documentation
* DONE Allow a unified %(album_track_number)s file template field
  If there's no album number, it's simply 2 digits of track number.
  Otherwise, it's a combination of the two fields.
  For example, album_number = 2 and track_number = 13 results in
  "213" for a value.
* TODO Update trackcat to take a cuesheet argument when outputting FLACs
  Thus, one can perform:
  trackcat --cuesheet=file.cue file1.wav file2.wav file3.wav -t flac -o cd.flac
  which will embed "file.cue" into "cd.flac" using metaflac.
  Though no other format I'm aware of supports this kind of cuesheet handling,
  being able to easily build solid disc images of a single FLAC file
  is much of the reason for trackcat/tracksplit.
* DONE Don't remove undone tracklint entries from its undo DB
  Since its checksum will change anyway and no longer match,
  explicitly removing the entry is no longer necessary

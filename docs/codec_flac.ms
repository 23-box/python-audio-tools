`Wasted Bits Per Sample' is typically a single bit set to 0, indicating
no wasted bits per sample.  Otherwise, it is a unary-encoded value

.SUBSUBSECTION "the CONSTANT subframe"
.PP
This is the simplest possible subframe.
It consists of a single value whose size is equal to the frame's
`Bits Per Sample'.
For instance, a 16-bit frame would have CONSTANT subframes 16 bits in length.
The value of the subframe is the value of all samples the subframe
contains.
An obvious use of this subframe is to store an entire subframe's worth
of digital silence (samples with a value of 0) very efficiently.

This subframe's length is equal to the `Bits Per Sample' multiplied
by the frame's `Block Size'.
Since it does no compression whatsoever and simply stores
audio samples as-is, this subframe is only suitable for especially
noisy portions of a track where no predictor can be found.

The number of warm-up samples equals the `Predictor Order'
(which is encoded in the `Subframe Type').
These samples are sent out as-is; they are the subframe's
`starting point' upon which further samples build when decompressing
the stream.
Determining the value of the current sample is then a matter of
looking backwards at previously decoded samples (or warm-up samples),
applying a simple formula on their values (which depends on the
Predictor Order) and adding the residual.

Don't be intimidated by the \[*S] if you're not math-inclined.
It simply means we're taking the sum of the calculated values from
0 to Order - 1, bit-shifting that sum down and added the residual
when determining the current sample.
Much like the FIXED subframe, LPC subframes also contain warm-up
samples which serve as our calculation's starting point.

Though the FLAC format allows for different forms of
residual coding, two forms of partitioned Rice are the only ones
currently supported.
The difference between the two is that when `Coding Method' is 0,
the Rice Parameter in each partition is 4 bits.
When the `Coding Method' is 1, that parameter is 5 bits.

There are @2 sup {"Partition Order"}@ number of Partitions.
The number of decoded samples in a Partition depends on the
its position in the subframe.
The first partition in the subframe contains:
.EQ
"Total Samples" mark = left (
{"Frame's Block Size" over {2 sup {"Partition Order"}}}
right )~~-~~"Predictor Order"
.EN
Subsequent partitions contain:
.EQ
"Total Samples" lineup = {"Frame's Block Size" over {2 sup {"Partition Order"}}}
.EN
Unless, of course, the Partition Order is 0.
In that case:
.EQ
"Total Samples" lineup = "Frame's Block Size"~~-~~"Predictor Order"
.EN
since there is only one partition which takes up the entire block.
.PP
If all of the bits in `Rice Parameter' are set,
the partition is unencoded binary using `Escape Code' number of bits per
sample.
.bp
.SUBSUBSUBSECTION "Rice Encoding"
.PP
The residual uses Rice coding to compress lots of mostly small values
in a very small amount of space.
To decode it, one first needs the Rice parameter.
Take a unary-encoded value\(dg from the bit stream, which are our most
significant bits (MSB).
.FS
\(dg In this instance, unary-encoding is a simple matter of
counting the number of 0 bits before the next 1 bit.
The resulting sum is the value.
.FE
Then take `parameter' number of additional bits, which are our least
significant bits (LSB).
Combine the two sets into our new value,
making the MSB set as the high bits and the LSB set as the low bits.
Bit 0 of this new value is the sign bit.
If it is 0, the actual value is equal to the rest of the bits.
If it is 1, the actual value is equal to the rest of the bits,
multiplied by -1 and minus 1.
.PP
This is less complicated than it sounds, so let's run through an example
in which the Rice parameter is 1:
.PSPIC -L "rice1.eps" 4.5i
.sp 24pt
Now, let's run through another example in which the Rice parameter is 4:
.PSPIC -L "rice2.eps" 6i
.bp
.SUBSUBSECTION "Channels"
.PP
Since most audio has more than one channel, it is important to
understand how FLAC handles putting it back together.
When channels are stored independently, one simply interleaves
them together in the proper order.
Let's take an example of 2 channel, 16-bit audio stored this way:
.begin dformat

style charwid 0

pic line dotted from F4.se to S4.ne
pic line dotted from F2.se to S2.ne
pic line dotted from F3.sw to S3.nw
.end dformat
This is the simplest case.
However, in the case of difference channels, one subframe will
contain actual channel data and the other channel will contain
signed difference data which is applied to the first channel
in order to reconstruct both channels.
It's very important to remember that the difference channel
has 1 additional bit per sample which will be consumed during
reconstruction.
Why 1 additional bit?
Let's take an example where the left sample's value is -30000
and the right sample's value is +30000.
Storing this pair as left + difference means the left
sample remains -30000 and the difference is -60000
.br
(-30000 \- -60000 = +30000).
-60000 won't fit into a 16-bit signed integer.
Adding that 1 additional bit doubles our range of values
and that's just enough to cover any possible difference between
two samples.

The mid channel case is another unusual exception.
We're prepending the mid channel with bit 0 from the
side channel, performing the addition/subtraction and then
discarding that bit before assigning the results to the left and
right channels.
.SUBSUBSECTION "Wasted bits per sample"
.PP
Though rare in practice, FLAC subframes support `wasted bits per sample'.
Put simply, these wasted bits are removed during subframe calculation
and restored to the subframe's least significant bits as zero value bits
when it is returned.
For instance, a subframe with 1 wasted bit per sample in a 16-bit FLAC
stream is treated as having only 15 bits per sample when reading
warm-up samples and then all through the rest of the subframe
calculation.
That wasted zero bit is then prepended to each sample prior to returning
the subframe.
.bp
.SUBSECTION "FLAC encoding"

For the purposes of discussing FLAC encoding,
we'll assume one has a stream of input PCM values along with the

.PP
The FLAC frame's block size in PCM frames
(called ``channel independent samples'' in FLAC's documentation)
is typically encoded in the 4 bit `block size' field.
But for odd-sized frames - which often occur at the end of the stream -
that value is stored as an 8 or 16 bit integer following UTF-8 encoded
frame number.
.PP
In addition, odd sample rate values are stored as 8 bit (in kHz),
16 bit (in Hz) or 16 bit (in 10s of Hz) prior to the CRC-8,
should a predefined value not be available.
.PP
Up until this point, nearly all of these fields can be filled from
the PCM stream data.
Unless you're writing a variable block size encoder (which no one has),
one should encode the frame number starting from 0 in the frame header
and choose a predefined block size for as many FLAC frames as possible.

If all the samples in a subframe are identical, one can encode them
using a CONSTANT subframe, which is essentially a single sample value
that gets duplicated `block size' number of times when decoded.
.SUBSUBSECTION "the VERBATIM subframe"
.PP
This subframe simply stores all the samples as-is,
with no compression whatsoever.
It is a `fallback' encoding method for when no other subframe makes one's
data any smaller.
.SUBSUBSECTION "the FIXED subframe"
.PP
This subframe consists of `predictor order' number of unencoded
warm-up samples followed by a residual.
Determining which predictor order to use on a given set of input samples
depends on their minimum delta sum.
This process is best explained by example:

In this example, @\[*D] sup 1@'s value of 26 is the smallest.
Therefore, when compressing this set of samples in a FIXED subframe,
it's best to use a predictor order of 1.

The predictor order indicates how many warm-up samples to take from
the PCM stream.
Determining the residual values can then be done automatically
based on the current @"Sample" sub i@ and previously encoded samples, or

.SUBSUBSECTION "the LPC subframe"

Unlike the FIXED subframe which required only input samples and a

an LPC precision value of those coefficients, and an LPC shift needed
value.

.SUBSUBSUBSECTION "Windowing"
.PP
The first step in LPC subframe encoding is `windowing' the input signal.
Put simply, this is a process of multiplying each input sample by
an equivalent value from the window, which are floats from 0.0 to 1.0.
In this case, the default is a Tukey window with a ratio of 0.5.
A Tukey window is a combination of the Hann and Rectangular windows.
The ratio of 0.5 means there's 0.5 samples in the Hann window per
sample in the Rectangular window.

The Hann window is defined by the function:

The Rectangular window is defined by the function:

The Tukey window is defined by taking a Hann window, splitting it at

.SUBSUBSUBSECTION "Computing autocorrelation"
.PP
Once our input samples have been converted to a windowed signal,
we then compute the autocorrelation values from that signal.
Each autocorrelation value is determined by multiplying the signal's
samples by the samples of a lagged version of that same signal,
and then taking the sum.
The lagged signal is simply the orignal signal with `lag' number of
samples removed from the beginning.
.PSPIC -L "lag.eps" 5i

The lagged sums from 0 to the maximum LPC order are our autocorrelation
values.  In this example, they are 11018, 9690 and 8443.

Given a stream of residual values, one must place them in one or more
partitions, each with its own Rice parameter, and prepended with a
small header.\(dg
.FS
\(dg See page \n(ZR for full details of how the residual is organized.
.FE
The residual's coding method is typically 0, unless one is encoding
audio with more than 16 bits-per-sample and one of the partitions
requests a Rice parameter higher than @2 sup 4@.
The residual's partition order is chosen exhaustively, which means
trying all of them within a certain range (e.g. 0 to 5) such that
the residuals can be divided evenly between them and then the partition
order which uses the smallest estimated amount of space is chosen.
.PP
Choosing the best Rice parameter is a matter of selecting the smallest
value of `x' such that:

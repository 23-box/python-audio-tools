tracklint \- checks and fixes minor track metadata errors automatically
.SH SYNOPSIS
tracklint [--fix] [--undo] [--db=filename] <track 1> [track 2] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
tracklint takes a list of audio tracks,
examines their metadata for common problems and suggests fixes for them.
If directories are given, tracklint searches them recursively
and suggests fixes for any audio tracks found.
tracklint can also perform any suggested metadata fixes if
requested, and undo any performed fixes if an undo database was
used.

.TP
\fB--undo\fR
Undo tracklint's fixes on the given audio tracks using information
from the undo database.
Tracks restored in this way will be byte-for-byte identical to
their original condition prior to running tracklint.
However, it is important that the tracks not be moved from
their original locations, or modified further, prior to using this
option.
If tracks are moved, tracklint will be unable to determine which
piece of undo information to apply.
If tracks are modified further, tracklint's undo information will
no longer be applicable.

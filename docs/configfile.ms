.SECTION "The Configuration File"
.PP
Because not all systems are alike, and hard-coding values into the
application is not pleasant for non-programmers, Python Audio Tools comes
with a small config file named \fCaudiotools.cfg\fR which contains
user-editable values.
These values include the default FreeDB server to use, the
default filename format for new tracks, the default
CD-ROM device to use for audio extraction/burning and, optionally,
alternative paths to required executables.
.PP
The format of this file is straightforward.
It consists of one or more sections.
Each section contains one or more \fCkey: value\fR pairs.

.SUBSECTION "Options precedence"
.PP
When Python Audio Tools needs an option, such as a FreeDB server name,
it looks in the following order:
.RS
.IP 1.
The command-line.
For example, specifying the \fB--freedb-server\fR command-line option
when executing a program overrides any values in config files.
.IP 2.
The \fC$(HOME)/.audiotools.cfg\fR config file.
This file has the same syntax as the system-wide \fC.audiotools.cfg\fR
file.
Since it need only contain the options that one wishes to override,
it may be smaller than the system-wide config file.
.IP 3.
The system-wide config file found in \fC/etc/audiotools.cfg\fR.
.RE
.PP
If no command-line option is given and no config files are found
Python Audio Tools will use some hard-coded default value, which may not
be what you want.
.bp
.SUBSECTION "The Filename Format"
.PP
The default filename format is a template string which contains
Python-style \fC%(key)s\fR wildcards which are replaced by actual values when
tracks are created or renamed.
Actual values are pulled from the file's own metadata or an external
XMCD file.

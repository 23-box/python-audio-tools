\chapter{Apple Lossless}

Apple's lossless audio codec, informally referred to as ``ALAC'',
is lossless audio inside a QuickTime container - similar to M4A.
Its stream is the same collection of atoms as covered on page
\pageref{m4a}.
The key difference is the contents of its \texttt{mdat} atom.

This is the typical arrangements of ALAC atoms as encoded by iTunes.
As you can see, it is almost identical to the layout of AAC audio.
One of the key differences is that ALAC's \texttt{stsd} atom
contains an \texttt{alac} description sub-atom rather than an
\texttt{mp4a} description atom.

Its layout is as follows:

\chapter{WavPack}
WavPack is a format for compressing Wave files, typically in lossless mode.
Notably, it also has a lossy mode and even a hybrid mode which allows
the `correction' file to be separated from a lossy core.

Metadata is stored as an APEv2 tag, which is described on page \pageref{apev2}.

Its stream of data is stored little-endian, as described on page
\pageref{bitstreams}.

\VAR{Block Size} is the length of everything in the block past
the \VAR{Block Size} field itself -
or everything in the block past the CRC, minus 24 bytes.

\VAR{Bits per Sample} is one of 4 values:

\begin{inparaenum}
\item[\texttt{00} = ] 8 bps,
\item[\texttt{01} = ] 16 bps,
\item[\texttt{10} = ] 24 bps,
\item[\texttt{11} = ] 32 bps
\end{inparaenum}
.

\VAR{Mono Output} bit indicates the channel count.
If 1, this block has 1 channel.
If 0, this block has 2 channels.
For an audio stream with more than 2 channels,
check the \VAR{Initial Block} and \VAR{Final Block} bits to indicate
the start and end of the channels.  As an example:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
Initial Block & Final Block & Mono Output & Channels \\
\hline
1 & 0 & 0 & 2 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 2 \\
\hline
\multicolumn{3}{r|}{Total} & 6
\end{tabular}

\subsection{WavPack sub-block}
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}
\par
\noindent
If the \VAR{Large Block} field is 0, the \VAR{Block Size} field is 8 bits long.
If it is 1, the \VAR{Block Size} field is 24 bits long.
The \VAR{Block Size} field is the length of \VAR{Block Data}, in 16-bit
words rather than bytes.
If \VAR{Actual Size 1 Less} is set, that means \VAR{Block Data} doesn't contain
an even number of bytes; it is padded with a single null byte at the
end in order to fit.
If \VAR{Nondecoder Data} is set, that means the decoder does not have
to understand the contents of this particular sub-block in
order to decode the audio.

\section{WavPack decoding}
The general principle of WavPack decoding is that we take the
values from several sub-blocks as decoder ``arguments''
and then decode one or two channels of audio per block.
If the file contains more than two channels, we combine the output
of several blocks into a single chunk of output data.

\subsection{the Decorrelation Terms sub-block}
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics{figures/wavpack_decorr_terms.pdf}
\end{figure}
\par
\noindent
The number of decorrelation terms and deltas
equals the \VAR{Block Size} times 2, and minus 1 if
\VAR{Actual Size 1 Less} is set.
Each term and delta pair is 8 bits and stored in \textit{reverse} order.
In addition, one must subtract 5 from the stored value of each
term to get its actual value.

For example, given the complete sub-block bytes:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
42 03 57 57 47 56 48 00
\end{Verbatim}
we have a total of 5 term/delta pairs whose values are as follows:
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabular}{r r | r r}
$\text{Decorrelation Term}_5$ & \texttt{0x17} - 5 = 18 & $\text{Decorrlation Delta}_5$ & \texttt{0x2} = 2 \\
$\text{Decorrelation Term}_4$ & \texttt{0x17} - 5 = 18 & $\text{Decorrlation Delta}_4$ & \texttt{0x2} = 2 \\
$\text{Decorrelation Term}_3$ & \texttt{0x07} - 5 = 2 & $\text{Decorrlation Delta}_3$ & \texttt{0x2} = 2 \\
$\text{Decorrelation Term}_2$ & \texttt{0x16} - 5 = 17 & $\text{Decorrlation Delta}_2$ & \texttt{0x2} = 2 \\
$\text{Decorrelation Term}_1$ & \texttt{0x08} - 5 = 3 & $\text{Decorrlation Delta}_1$ & \texttt{0x2} = 2 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\par
\noindent
Remember that this is a little-endian stream and that the least-significant
bits (the \VAR{Decorrelation Delta} value) are on the left side of each byte.
